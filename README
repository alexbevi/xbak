xBaK is licensed under the GPL. See COPYING for more information.

Required tools and software:
* SDL ("http://www.libsdl.org")

To build on linux change to the directory where xBaK sources are extracted.
Next run "./configure" and, if no errors are reported, continu to run "make".
There is no need to run "make install" yet. The resulting executables can be
found in the "./src" subdirectory.

If the configure script fails, try running "./autogen.sh" to recreate all
files generated by the autotools. This requires:
* autoconf-2.59
* automake-1.9.x

Once the configure scripts is built successfully, retry from the start.

Please report errors or bugs using the bug tracker provided on the project
website.
