xBaK is licensed under the GPL. See COPYING for more information.

Required tools and software:
* SDL       ("http://www.libsdl.org/")
* SDL_mixer ("http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/")
* SDL_sound ("http://icculus.org/SDL_sound/")

To build on linux change to the directory where xBaK sources are extracted.
Next run "./configure" and, if no errors are reported, continu to run "make".
There is no need to run "make install" yet. The resulting executables can be
found in the "./src" subdirectory.

If the configure script fails, try running "./autogen.sh" to recreate all
files generated by the autotools. This requires:
* autoconf-2.59
* automake-1.9.x

Once the configure scripts is built successfully, retry from the start.

Notes for running the xbak demo:
* Original data files
  The original data files must be stored in one of the following
  directories:
   - /opt/krondor/
   - /opt/share/krondor/
   - /usr/share/krondor/
   - /usr/local/share/krondor/
   - /krondor/
   - ./krondor/
   - ../krondor/
* Grabbing keyboard and mouse
  Initially the keyboard and mouse are not grabbed. Grabbing the input
  can be toggled by pressing the F12 key. Or, if the input is not grabbed,
  move the mouse inside the xbak application window and press the left
  or right mouse button to grab the input. When the input is grabbed,
  pressing the middle mouse button will release the grab on input.
* Screenshots
  Screenshots can be made using the F11 key. The screenshots will be saved
  in the current directory. The images are stored in BMP format. The
  filenames have the following form: xbak_<nnn>.bmp, with <nnn> ranging
  from 001 to 999.

Please report errors or bugs using the bug tracker provided on the project
website.
