xBaK is licensed under the GPL version 2. See COPYING for more information.

Required tools and software (minimum version is listed):
* SDL-1.2.8       ("http://www.libsdl.org/")

Optional tools and software (minimum version is listed):
* SDL_mixer-1.2.6 ("http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/")
* SDL_sound-1.0.1 ("http://icculus.org/SDL_sound/")
SDL_sound also requires a GUS compatible set of sound patches.

To build on linux change to the directory where xBaK sources are extracted.
Next run "./configure" and, if no errors are reported, continu to run "make".
There is no need to run "make install" yet. The resulting executables can be
found in the "./src" subdirectory.

If the configure script fails, try running "./autogen.sh" to recreate all
files generated by the autotools. This requires:
* autoconf-2.59
* automake-1.9.x

Once the configure script is built successfully, retry from the start.

Notes for running the xBaK game:
* Original data files
  xBaK requires the following files, containing resource data:
  - krondor.rmf
  - krondor.001
  - frp.sx
  - startup.gam
  Note that the filenames are in lower case. You might need to rename them.
  These original data files must be stored in one of the following
  directories:
   - /opt/krondor/
   - /opt/share/krondor/
   - /krondor/
   - ./krondor/
   - ../krondor/
* Other files
  On Linux/BSD/Unix platforms xbak will create its own directory structure
  for user specific data on startup. The directory structure is as follows:
    ~/.xbak           # for user data
    ~/.xbak/capture   # for screenshots
    ~/.xbak/games     # for saved games
  On other platforms the current directory is used for everything, except
  the original Betrayal at Krondor data files mentioned above.
* Grabbing keyboard and mouse
  Initially the keyboard and mouse are not grabbed. Grabbing the input
  can be toggled by pressing the F12 key. Or, if the input is not grabbed,
  move the mouse inside the xbak application window and press the left
  or right mouse button to grab the input. When the input is grabbed,
  pressing the middle mouse button will release the grab on input.
* Screenshots
  Screenshots can be made using the F11 key. The screenshots will be saved
  in the dedicated screenshot directory mentioned earlier. The images are
  stored in BMP format. The filenames have the following form:
  xbak_<nnn>.bmp, with <nnn> ranging from 001 to 999. Pre-existing screenshot
  files will be overwritten.
